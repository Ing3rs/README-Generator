# Professional README Generator

## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

This project is designed to quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one.

## Installation

To install this application, open command line and run 'npm install' to install the following dependances: 
  * [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)


## Usage

Once installed, the application can be invoked by using the following command:

Answer each prompt and when completed a README will be automatically generated in the 'gerenatedREADME.md' file using your input.

## Next steps

In future, I would like to: 
* allow users to skip sections they do not require
* improve the application so that it runs in the broswer, allowing users to add bullet points, paragraph breaks etc.
